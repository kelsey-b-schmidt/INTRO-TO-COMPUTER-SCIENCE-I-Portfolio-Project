    Creates a class called OrthokonBoard that represents the board
    for a two-player game that is played on a 4x4 grid.
    This class does not do everything needed to play a game
    - it's just responsible for handling the rules concerning the game board.
    The board starts with four Red pieces (R) on row 0 and four Yellow pieces (Y) on row 3.
    A valid move consists of a player moving one of their pieces orthogonally or diagonally
    as far as it can go until it hits another piece or the edge of the board
    (it must move at least one space).
    After the piece stops, any opponent pieces on orthogonally adjacent squares
    are flipped over to its color.
    The OrthokonBoard class doesn't keep track of whose turn it is,
    so it will allow multiple moves by the same player consecutively.
    A player wins upon making a move that either flips over
    the remaining opponent pieces or leaves the opponent without a move.
    The class has private data members for:
            1. a representation of the board (4 lists within a list)
            2. the current state, which holds one of the three following values:
                "RED_WON", "YELLOW_WON", or "UNFINISHED"
    The class includes the following methods:
        1. An init method that takes no parameters,
            initializes the starting board positions,
            and initializes the current state to "UNFINISHED"
        2. A method named print_board that prints out the board.
            (Does not return anything, print function is within the method)
        3. A get method named get_current_state, which returns the current state.
        4. A method named make_move that takes four parameters (in the specific order listed):
                A. The row of the piece being moved
                B. The column of the piece being moved
                C. The row of the intended position that piece will be moved to
                D. The column f the intended position that piece will be moved to
        Rows are numbered from top to bottom (0, 1, 2, 3),
        Columns are numbered from left to right (0, 1, 2, 3)
        If the game has already been won, or if the move is not valid,
        make_move will return False.
        Otherwise, it will record the move, update the board,
        update the current state if the move caused a win, and return True.
